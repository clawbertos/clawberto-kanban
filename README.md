# Clawberto Mission Control

Live Kanban + status board for Satya ↔️ Clawberto operations.

- `KANBAN.md`: Source of truth for every task (Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done).
- `render_html.py`: Automation that renders the Markdown board into HTML.
- `index.html`: Published view generated by the script above.
- Updates: Jobs (our Steve Jobs-inspired PM agent) owns this board and announces significant changes directly to Satya on Telegram.

## Update Workflow
1. Edit `KANBAN.md` (or have the Jobs agent do it).
2. Run `./render_html.py` to regenerate `index.html` (timestamp auto-updated).
3. `git add kanban-board/KANBAN.md kanban-board/index.html` and commit/push.
4. Have Jobs send a Telegram DM if the change is meaningful.

More polish (multi-agent hooks, automated deploys) is coming soon.
